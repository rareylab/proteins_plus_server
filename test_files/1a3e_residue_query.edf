# EDF Format to define binding site and ensemble.
# Lines starting with a '#' character are considered as comments.
# Use the REFERENCE line to define a reference protein.
# This line is also considered as the beginning of a new ensemble entry.

REFERENCE ./data/referenceStructures/1a3e.pdb

# Use RESIDUE lines to define the residues of the query binding site.
# Please use the residue's name, it's chain identifier and the serial number
# as specified in the REFERENCE PDB file to define a residue that should be part
# of the query. Additional 'insertion codes' in the REFERENCE PDB file must also
# be specified here. Please use the following order:
# RESIDUE residueName chainIdentifier serialNumber <insertion code>
